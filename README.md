Zoomy allows you to add seamless scrollView and instagram like zooming to UIImageViews in any view hierarchy.

## Example

![](Art/Gif/1.gif)![](Art/Gif/2.gif)![](Art/Gif/3.gif)

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Setup
Just add

```swift
import Zoomy
```
to the files that of the code that needs zoombehavior.

## Usage
All of the folowing snippets are expected to be called from within to your viewcontroller. 

Somewhere after `viewDidLoad` should work just fine.

### Scrollable zooming

```swift
addZoombehavior(for: imageView)
```

### Insta zooming

```swift
addZoombehavior(for: imageView, settings: .instaZoomSettings)
```

### Zooming above navigationbar/tabbar

```swift
guard let parentView = parent?.view else { return }
addZoombehavior(for: imageView, in:parentView)
```

### Zooming below UI element

```swift
addZoombehavior(for: imageView, below: dismissButton)
```

### Zooming with some custom gesture actions

```swift
let settings = Settings.defaultSettings
    .with(actionOnTapOverlay: Action.dismissOverlay)
    .with(actionOnDoubleTapImageView: Action.zoomIn)
        
addZoombehavior(for: imageView, settings: settings)
```

There's a lot more [triggers](https://github.com/lvnkmn/Zoomy/blob/3c6e6195190515522dd84d2653f61acdfaeef897/Zoomy/Classes/Structs/ImageZoomControllerSettings.swift#L44-L72) and [actions](https://github.com/lvnkmn/Zoomy/blob/3c6e6195190515522dd84d2653f61acdfaeef897/Zoomy/Classes/Classes/ImageZoomControllerActions.swift#L8-L26) to choose from.

### Zooming a collectionviewcell

```swift
public func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
    
    //After your regular dequeue and configuration:
    addZoombehavior(for: cell.imageView)
        
    return cell
}
```

### Other examples

`pod try 'Zoomy'` to load the example project.

Or check some of the sample code directly:

* [Zooming scrollable images](https://github.com/lvnkmn/Zoomy/blob/3c6e6195190515522dd84d2653f61acdfaeef897/Example/Zoomy/StackViewImagesViewController.swift)
* [Zooming underneath floating action button](https://github.com/lvnkmn/Zoomy/blob/3c6e6195190515522dd84d2653f61acdfaeef897/Example/Zoomy/FloatingActionButtonViewController.swift)
* [Dynamically changing gesture actions](https://github.com/lvnkmn/Zoomy/blob/3c6e6195190515522dd84d2653f61acdfaeef897/Example/Zoomy/ChangingActionsViewController.swift)

### A note about zooming images that live inside scrollviews

Zooming inside any viewhierarchy will work perfectly fine using Zoomy, however sometimes you want to disable existing behaviors while zooming. A good example of this is when zooming images that are subviews of a scrollview.

For best performance just implement these Zoomy.Delegate methods:

```swift
extension YourViewController: Zoomy.Delegate {
    
    func didBeginPresentingOverlay(for imageView: Zoomable) {
        scrollView.isScrollEnabled = false
    }
    
    func didEndPresentingOverlay(for imageView: Zoomable) {
        scrollView.isScrollEnabled = true
    }
}
```

No need to set the viewController as a delegate to anyting. This is infered using conditional conformance. In case you're interested in seeing how this is done, see [this](https://github.com/lvnkmn/Zoomy/blob/3c6e6195190515522dd84d2653f61acdfaeef897/Zoomy/Classes/Extensions/UIViewController%2BCanManageZoomBehavior.swift#L3) and [this](https://github.com/lvnkmn/Zoomy/blob/3c6e6195190515522dd84d2653f61acdfaeef897/Zoomy/Classes/ExtendedProtocols/CanManageZoomBehaviors.swift#L72).

## Texture

All the code examples provided above work with texture's `ImageNode` as well. All that is needed for this is adding `extension ASImageNode: Zoomable {}` anywhere in your targets sources. See the example projects for basic and more advanced usage of texture.

## There's more to come

See the [roadmap](https://github.com/lvnkmn/Zoomy/labels/roadmap) for upcoming features.

Missing anyting or something is not working as desired? [Create an issue](https://github.com/lvnkmn/Zoomy/issues/new) and it will likely be picked up. 

## Support

There may not always be time for personal support on how to implement Zoomy in different scenario's. Hopefully the code is clear enough to get done what's needed ðŸ’ª. In case you've implemented a scenario thats not described in this readme or the examples, feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/lvnkmn/Zoomy/compare?expand=1), that would be pretty cool actually.  

## Installation

Zoomy is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Zoomy'
```
